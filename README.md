# dwm
This works only in \*nix environments

One of the main advantages for me is dwm is completely written in C programming language
and since I am proficient in C, I will be able to configure or make changes or even create some
features in the furture that I might want my windows tilting manager to do.

This window tilting manager is blazing fast and helps me get things done really fast.
If you have not tried any window tilting managers then I recommend you to try it
because typing is really faster than clicking in mouse. I also type at about 60 wpm in
my computer which helps me when typing long commands in CLI.
