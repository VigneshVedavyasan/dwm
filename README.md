This works only in \*nix environments

One of the main advantages for me is dwm is completely written in C programming language
and since I am proficient in C I will be able to configure or make changes or even create some
features in the furture that I might require in my PC.

This window tilting manager is blazing fast and helps me get things done really fast.
If you have not tried any window tilting managers then I recommend you to try it
typing is really faster than clicking in mouse. I am also type at about 60 wpm in
my computer and it helps a bit when typing long commands in CLI.
